# Fly bird, fly

The current version of this project is deployed at: https://flybirdfly.netlify.app/

## What is this project?

This is a test project that I'm creating to explore the capabilities of Three.js.

I started it on 10/10/2023 and I'm working on it as I have time, so it's still on the beginning and the code organization is far from what I want it to be soon.

My intention is to create very simple game where the player will relax flying around, collecting items and discovering some secret messages about this world.


While doing that, for study reasons, I'm abstracting functionalities that I see as useful to reutilize and moving them to the "Engine" folder.

So, in the end, I intend to have my own simple game engine based on Three.js, making it easier for me to create more games with it.
